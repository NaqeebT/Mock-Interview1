What types of Variables do we have in JAVA? Define all of them and explain the differences?

Variables in JAVA are containers for storing data values. There are two different types of
Variables in JAVA. Primitive Data types, and, Reference Data types.

1. Primitive Data types:

There are 8 different types of Primitive Data types:

A. Byte: Can hold the values of 127 up to -128, (8-bit Signed Integer).

B. Short: Can hold the values of 32767 up to -32768, (16- bit signed Integer).

C. Integer:      (32-bit Signed Integer).

D. Long: Is used when the value is larger than an Integer, (64-bit singed Integer).

E. Float: Is used instead of double to save memory in large Arrays, (32-bit singed Integer- Point numbers).

F. Double: This is used as a default choice for decimal values, (64-bit floating- Point numbers).

G. Char: This is a simple enumeration beginning with Zero, (16-bit Unicode characters).

H. Boolean: They only represent one bit of information "True" or "False".

2. Reference Data type:

They are used to store memory addresses that point to the location of an object. Means, that the codes, identifiers,
and categorical values that are not subject to change. They include, Classes, Interfaces, Arrays, and Enums.
Object of these types Variables created by using the "new" keyword.
